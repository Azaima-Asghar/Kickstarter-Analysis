# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Description of the project

Louise wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever", with an estimated budget of $10,000 and she is hesitant jumping into the fundraising campaign without any knowledge of what characteristics will make her campaign successful. This project organizes, sorts and analyzes the crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that will make project campaign successful and what aspects will assist Louise to kick start her production.

After performing detailed analysis on the Kickstarter data in excel, one the finding was to have a realist goal amount to raise for the campaign makes it prosperous, the following line chart shows that the lower goal amounts, the higher the success rate.

The time of the year the campaign takes place also contributes to its success. Most of the campaigns that did well were launched in the early summer, campaigns taking place in winter time were less successful. The following line chart shows that most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. On the other hand, December doesnâ€™t seem like a great time to launch a campaign.

One of the factors that also affects the success of the fundraising campaign is the length of the campaign, the campaigns with a length of 30 days did far better than the campaigns that lasted longer.

# Summary 

I would recommend Louise should try to keep a realistic goal amount she wants to raise for her play "Fever" from the fundraising campaign to have greater chances of success. She should also make her campaign to have a shorter length and she should aim to launch her fundraising campaign in summer time. This will increase the probability that Louise will have a successful campaign.
